# SmartText Security Audit Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from a security audit of the SmartText application, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data access controls.

## Authentication

- **Supabase Auth**: The application uses Supabase Auth with magic links (email OTP) for authentication.
- **Service Role Key**: The application correctly uses the service role key for admin operations and the anon key for client operations.
- **Environment Variables**: The necessary Supabase environment variables are properly configured in the `.env.local` file.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

### Businesses Table

- ✅ **Read Access**: Users can only read their own business data.
- ✅ **Write Access**: Users can only update their own business data.
- ✅ **Delete Protection**: Users cannot delete other users' businesses.

### Conversations and Missed Calls Tables

- ❓ **Tables Not Found**: The conversations and missed_calls tables do not exist in the database. This could be because:
  - The tables have not been created yet
  - The tables have different names
  - The functionality is implemented differently

## Route Protection

- ✅ **Protected Routes**: The `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/conversations`, `/dashboard/missed-calls`, and `/dashboard/settings` routes are protected by middleware.
- ✅ **Redirect Logic**: Users without a business are redirected to `/onboarding`, while users with a business are redirected to `/dashboard`.

## Trial Plan Implementation

- ❓ **Trial Plan Fields**: The `trial_plan` and `trial_expiration_date` fields do not exist in the businesses table. The schema.sql file includes these fields, but they haven't been applied to the database.

## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Tables**: If conversations and missed calls functionality is needed, create the necessary tables with appropriate RLS policies.
2. **Apply Schema Updates**: Run the `apply-schema.js` script to apply the schema.sql file, which includes the trial plan fields.
3. **Implement Trial Logic**: Add logic to automatically place new users into a trial plan and set a trial expiration date 14 days in the future.
4. **Error Boundaries**: Ensure fallback UI and error boundaries are in place for handling Supabase errors or failed fetches.

## Conclusion

The application has strong authentication and authorization controls in place. The Row Level Security policies are correctly implemented for the businesses table, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own data. However, some planned features like conversations, missed calls, and trial plans are not fully implemented in the database.

## Testing Scripts

The following scripts were created or modified to verify the security of the application:

- `test-rls-policies.js`: Tests Row Level Security policies on the businesses table.
- `add-trial-plan-fields.js`: Adds trial plan fields to the businesses table.
- `verify-live-onboarding.js`: Verifies the onboarding flow, including authentication and business creation.

These scripts can be run periodically to ensure that security controls remain effective as the application evolves.
