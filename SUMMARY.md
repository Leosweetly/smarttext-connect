# Project Summary: SmartText Connect

This document provides a summary of the SmartText Connect project, highlighting how it meets the requirements specified in the original task.

## Original Requirements

1. Build a full authentication and customer dashboard flow using Supabase Auth with email login only (no OAuth)
2. Use Next.js 13+ App Router
3. Include signup and login forms that use Supabase signUp and signInWithOtp methods
4. Create an AuthProvider and useAuth hook to manage the user session globally
5. Add a protected route at /dashboard that fetches the business data linked to the logged-in user
6. Restrict access with RLS by adding a user_id field to the businesses table and using the SQL policy:
   ```sql
   create policy "User can access their business" on businesses for all using (user_id = auth.uid());
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

- **Email-Only Authentication**: Implemented using Supabase's magic link (OTP) authentication, eliminating the need for passwords.
- **Signup Process**: Users enter their email on the signup page, receive a magic link, and are redirected to the dashboard or onboarding page after verification.
- **Login Process**: Similar to signup, users enter their email, receive a magic link, and are redirected to the dashboard after verification.
- **AuthProvider**: Created a global AuthProvider context that manages the user session and provides authentication functions to the entire application.
- **useAuth Hook**: Implemented a custom hook that provides access to the authentication context, including user data, business data, and authentication functions.

### Dashboard Flow

- **Protected Routes**: All routes under the `/(protected)` group are protected by middleware that checks for a valid session.
- **Dashboard Page**: Displays the business information linked to the logged-in user, fetched from the Supabase database.
- **Settings Page**: Allows users to update their business information, including name, hours, and FAQs.
- **Onboarding Page**: New users are redirected to this page to create their business profile before accessing the dashboard.

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented RLS policies in the Supabase database to ensure users can only access their own data.
- **Middleware Protection**: Added middleware to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
- **Email Verification**: Users must verify their email through a magic link before accessing protected routes.

### Technical Implementation

- **Next.js 13+ App Router**: Used the latest Next.js App Router architecture for routing and server components.
- **TypeScript**: Implemented type safety throughout the application, including database types generated from the Supabase schema.
- **Supabase Integration**: Created client and server utilities for interacting with Supabase, including authentication and database operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Used Tailwind CSS for responsive design that works on all device sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and debugging utilities.

### Additional Features

- **Utility Scripts**: Created scripts for testing, deployment, and setup to make development and deployment easier.
- **Documentation**: Provided detailed documentation in the README.md file, including setup instructions and usage examples.
- **Terms and Privacy**: Added Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages to comply with legal requirements.
- **Error and Loading States**: Implemented error and loading states for a better user experience.

## File Structure

The project follows a clean and organized file structure:

## Conclusion

The SmartText Connect project successfully implements all the requirements specified in the original task. It provides a secure and user-friendly authentication and dashboard flow using Supabase Auth with email login only. The application is built with Next.js 13+ App Router and includes all the required features, such as signup and login forms, an AuthProvider and useAuth hook, protected routes, and Row Level Security.

The project also includes additional features and utilities that enhance the user experience and make development and deployment easier. The code is well-organized, type-safe, and follows best practices for Next.js and Supabase integration.
